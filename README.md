# Evaluating-the-Efficiency-of-Retail-Stores-in-a-Supermarket-Chain-using-DEA-in-R
This project utilizes Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in R to evaluate and compare the operational efficiency of retail stores within a supermarket chain.

A supermarket chain operates 10 retail stores across various regions. The management seeks to assess the efficiency of these stores to identify best practices and areas for improvement. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is used to measure the efficiency of each store based on their ability to utilize resources effectively to generate revenue and achieve high customer satisfaction.


Inputs for DEA model are: 
  1. Labor Hours (Input1): The total number of labor hours utilized by each store.
  2. Operating Costs (Input2): The total operating costs (in thousands of dollars) for each store.

Outputs for DEA model are: 
  1. Revenue (Output1): The total revenue (in thousands of dollars) generated by each store.
  2. Customer Satisfaction Score (Output2): The customer satisfaction score out of 100 for each store.

R software is utilized to perform DEA on this data.

Results:
The DEA analysis provided efficiency scores for each store, ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a fully efficient store. Stores with scores less than 1 were identified as inefficient compared to the best-performing stores. Here is the list of efficiency results for the 10 stores:

1. Store1: 0.4956801
2. Store2: 0.9987869
3. Store3: 0.6159296
4. Store4: 0.6564777
5. Store5: 1.0000000
6. Store6: 1.0000000
7. Store7: 0.5085464
8. Store8: 0.4240237
9. Store9: 1.0000000
10. Store10: 1.0000000

Recommendations:

1. Best Practices: The management should analyze the practices of the efficient stores to identify strategies that can be implemented across the chain.
2. Resource Allocation: Stores identified as less efficient may require better resource allocation and management practices.
3. Training and Development: Providing training to the staff of inefficient stores could help in improving their performance.
